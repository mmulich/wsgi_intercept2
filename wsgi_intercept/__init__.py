"""installs a WSGI application in place of a real URI for testing.

Introduction
============

Testing a WSGI application normally involves starting a server at a local host and port, then pointing your test code to that address.  Instead, this library lets you intercept calls to any specific host/port combination and redirect them into a `WSGI application`_ importable by your test program.  Thus, you can avoid spawning multiple processes or threads to test your Web app.

How Does It Work?
=================

``wsgi_intercept`` works by replacing ``httplib.HTTPConnection`` with a subclass, ``wsgi_intercept.WSGI_HTTPConnection``.  This class then redirects specific server/port combinations into a WSGI application by emulating a socket.  If no intercept is registered for the host and port requested, those requests are passed on to the standard handler.

The functions ``add_wsgi_intercept(host, port, app_create_fn, script_name='')`` and ``remove_wsgi_intercept(host,port)`` specify which URLs should be redirect into what applications.  Note especially that ``app_create_fn`` is a *function object* returning a WSGI application; ``script_name`` becomes ``SCRIPT_NAME`` in the WSGI app's environment, if set.

Install
=======

::

    easy_install wsgi_intercept

(The ``easy_install`` command is bundled with the setuptools_ module)

To use a `development version`_ of wsgi_intercept, run::
    
    easy_install http://wsgi-intercept.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

.. _setuptools: http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/setuptools/
.. _development version: http://wsgi-intercept.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/#egg=wsgi_intercept-dev

Packages Intercepted
====================

Unfortunately each of the Web testing frameworks uses its own specific mechanism for making HTTP call-outs, so individual implementations are needed.  Below are the packages supported and how to create an intercept.

urllib2
-------

urllib2_ is a standard Python module, and ``urllib2.urlopen`` is a pretty
normal way to open URLs.

The following code will install the WSGI intercept stuff as a default
urllib2 handler: ::

   >>> from wsgi_intercept.urllib2_intercept import install_opener
   >>> install_opener() #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
   <urllib2.OpenerDirector instance at ...>
   >>> import wsgi_intercept
   >>> from wsgi_intercept.test_wsgi_app import create_fn
   >>> wsgi_intercept.add_wsgi_intercept('some_host', 80, create_fn)
   >>> import urllib2
   >>> urllib2.urlopen('http://some_host:80/').read()
   'WSGI intercept successful!\\n'

The only tricky bit in there is that different handler classes need to
be constructed for Python 2.3 and Python 2.4, because the httplib
interface changed between those versions.

.. _urllib2: http://docs.python.org/lib/module-urllib2.html

httplib2
--------

httplib2_ is a 3rd party extension of the built-in ``httplib``.  To intercept 
requests, it is similar to urllib2::

    >>> from wsgi_intercept.httplib2_intercept import install
    >>> install()
    >>> import wsgi_intercept
    >>> from wsgi_intercept.test_wsgi_app import create_fn
    >>> wsgi_intercept.add_wsgi_intercept('some_host', 80, create_fn)
    >>> import httplib2
    >>> resp, content = httplib2.Http().request('http://some_host:80/', 'GET') 
    >>> content
    'WSGI intercept successful!\\n'

(Contributed by `David "Whit" Morris`_.)

webtest
-------

webtest_ is an extension to ``unittest`` that has some nice functions for
testing Web sites.

To install the WSGI intercept handler, do ::

    >>> import wsgi_intercept.webtest_intercept
    >>> class WSGI_Test(wsgi_intercept.webtest_intercept.WebCase):
    ...     HTTP_CONN = wsgi_intercept.WSGI_HTTPConnection
    ...     HOST='localhost'
    ...     PORT=80
    ... 
    ...     def setUp(self):
    ...         wsgi_intercept.add_wsgi_intercept(self.HOST, self.PORT, create_fn)
    ... 
    >>> 

.. _webtest: http://www.cherrypy.org/file/trunk/cherrypy/test/webtest.py

webunit
-------

webunit_ is another unittest-like framework that contains nice functions
for Web testing.  (funkload_ uses webunit, too.)

webunit needed to be patched to support different scheme handlers.
The patched package is in webunit/wsgi_webunit/, and the only
file that was changed was webunittest.py; the original is in
webunittest-orig.py.

To install the WSGI intercept handler, do ::

    >>> from httplib import HTTP
    >>> import wsgi_intercept.webunit_intercept
    >>> class WSGI_HTTP(HTTP):
    ...     _connection_class = wsgi_intercept.WSGI_HTTPConnection
    ... 
    >>> class WSGI_WebTestCase(wsgi_intercept.webunit_intercept.WebTestCase):
    ...     scheme_handlers = dict(http=WSGI_HTTP)
    ... 
    ...     def setUp(self):
    ...         wsgi_intercept.add_wsgi_intercept('127.0.0.1', 80, create_fn)
    ... 
    >>> 

.. _webunit: http://mechanicalcat.net/tech/webunit/

mechanize
---------

mechanize_ is John J. Lee's port of Perl's WWW::Mechanize to Python.
It mimics a browser.  (It's also what's behind twill_.)

mechanize is just as easy as mechanoid: ::

   >>> import wsgi_intercept.mechanize_intercept
   >>> from wsgi_intercept.test_wsgi_app import create_fn
   >>> wsgi_intercept.add_wsgi_intercept('some_host', 80, create_fn)
   >>> b = wsgi_intercept.mechanize_intercept.Browser()
   >>> response = b.open('http://some_host:80')
   >>> response.read()
   'WSGI intercept successful!\\n'

.. _mechanize: http://wwwsearch.sf.net/

mechanoid
---------

mechanoid_ is a fork of mechanize_. ::

   >>> import wsgi_intercept.mechanoid_intercept
   >>> from wsgi_intercept.test_wsgi_app import create_fn
   >>> wsgi_intercept.add_wsgi_intercept('some_host', 80, create_fn)
   >>> b = wsgi_intercept.mechanoid_intercept.Browser()
   >>> response = b.open('http://some_host:80')
   >>> response.read()
   'WSGI intercept successful!\\n'
   
.. _mechanoid: http://www.python.org/pypi/mechanoid/

zope.testbrowser
----------------

zope.testbrowser_ is a prettified interface to mechanize_ that is used
primarily for testing Zope applications.

zope.testbrowser is also pretty easy ::
    
    >>> import wsgi_intercept.zope_testbrowser
    >>> from wsgi_intercept.test_wsgi_app import create_fn
    >>> wsgi_intercept.add_wsgi_intercept('some_host', 80, create_fn)
    >>> b = wsgi_intercept.zope_testbrowser.WSGI_Browser('http://some_host:80/')
    >>> b.contents
    'WSGI intercept successful!\\n'
            
.. _zope.testbrowser: http://www.python.org/pypi/zope.testbrowser

History
=======

Pursuant to Ian Bicking's `"best Web testing framework"`_ post,
Titus Brown put together an `in-process HTTP-to-WSGI interception mechanism`_ for
his own Web testing system, twill_.  Because the mechanism is pretty
generic -- it works at the httplib level -- Titus decided to try adding it into
all of the *other* Python Web testing frameworks.

This is the result.

Mocking your HTTP Server
========================

Marc Hedlund has gone one further, and written a full-blown mock HTTP
server for wsgi_intercept.  Combined with wsgi_intercept itself, this
lets you entirely replace client calls to a server with a mock setup
that hits neither the network nor server code.  You can see his work
in the file ``mock_http.py``.  Run ``mock_http.py`` to see a test.
